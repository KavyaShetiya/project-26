A basic sambar recipe is made by cooking vegetables and lentils separately. The lentils are cooked till it is mushy and then mashed.


Cooked vegetables, mashed dal, tamarind pulp and sambar powder are mixed together and then simmered for some minutes.

Later a tempering is done of oil (or ghee) with mustard seeds, curry leaves, asafoetida (hing) and dry red chilies. This tempering or tadka is added to sambar.

The vegetables can be steamed or boiled in water. According to my experience, when the vegetables are cooked or boiled in water, the broth or stew becomes very flavorful. The sambar made this way has better flavors as compared to the sambar made with steamed vegetables.

My recipe follows the method of cooking vegetables in water, that makes for a flavorful stew. So when all the elements of the dish come together, what you get is a really delicious complexly flavored sambar recipe.
